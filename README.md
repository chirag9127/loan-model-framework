# FELA: Fair and Explainable Loan Approval Framework
FELA (Fair and Explainable Loan Approval) is a Python-based framework designed to assist machine learning engineers in building fair and explainable models for loan approvals. This framework incorporates fairness metrics, Shapley values, and exploratory data analysis techniques to promote transparency and mitigate bias in loan approval systems.

Loan approval processes are critical and must be fair and unbiased to ensure equal opportunities for all individuals. FELA addresses these concerns by providing a set of functionalities that aid in evaluating and improving the fairness and explainability of loan approval models.
